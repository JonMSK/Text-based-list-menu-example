# What-is-this?

"This" is a text-based mod menu list base (wont actually work with games) I created using C++ over the course of 2 days (around 5 hours worth of work on this).
If you are familiar with games and/or game modding you will most likely be familiar with mod menu bases. This is an example of a list base.
If you are not familiar visit the unknowncheats.me forum and go to BigBase thread in Grand Theft Auto V section and do some research on how GTA V mod menus work, maybe try making a few options with BigBase V1 (list base).

# What-is-this-used-for?

You can skip this paragraph if you want: When I wanted to create my own GTA V base I knew how the backend worked as in function sigs, hooking, and more. However, I had no idea how the ui functioned and how options and submenus worked. I had to read through the ui code and analyse it line-by-line to gain an understanding of how BigBase's submenu and option system worked. Now that I do I decided to create a text-based one that doesn't work with games but is just a bit of fun and does, however, include option examples. I realised at the end of making it that I had created a simplified version of BigBase's submenu and option system that consisted of few yet efficient lines of code per file and would be helpful to someone wishing to learn how to make mod menu bases.

This serves as a teaching method for people wanting to learn how list mod menu bases (can) work. Obviously there are multiple ways you could make a list base for a game, but this is one way to do it well and is simple to learn from. 

I will, in the future, create a small documentation for this so beginners can understand how to use the base for fun and learning and I will also at some point make some file detailing the theory involved in making this base and how individual features work.

If you have any questions related to the base feel free to contact me on discord: mikefan123#4217. 
Please don't spam me or ask ridiculous questions without researching it first or you will be ignored. I may be generous and help but usually I wont if the question is ridiculour.
